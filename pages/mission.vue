                    <p>Unabated capitalism and an overreliance on technology is what got us into this mess. And as great as it would be, it seems unlikely that those same things will get us back out. Maybe a Fortune 100 company will altruistically create an Aritifical Intelligence robot that completely eliminates our thirst for authentic human connection... but we’re not going to sit around waiting for that to happen.</p>
                    <p>It’s for this reason that FHS is an ultra low-tech solution, despite being founded by a former UI Designer, Full-Stack Developer, and Machine Learning Engineer. The lack of "sophistication" is on purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>And it’s for this reason that FHS gives away 50% of its profits (though, disclaimer, we don't have any profits yet) to POC-, woman-, and trans-led organizations working to bring diversity and equity to tech. One day we might pivot to nonprofit and give away 100% of profits, but for now 50% seems like a healthy balance. If you have thoughts on this I'd love to hear them!</p>

                <p>"You just have to show up consistently" is the most cliched advice that influencers give. Because it's the thing we solopreneurs and freelancers are so epicly bad at. Things get tough and we hide. This is not laziness. It's fear. It's depression, or anxiety, or imposter syndrome, or shame, or perfectionism, or any of a number of things. I suffer these things just as badly as anybody else I've ever met, and I've also managed to fight through them.
