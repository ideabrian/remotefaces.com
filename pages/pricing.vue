              <h3 class="mb-1">Can I pay on behalf of my followers or community members?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes. The default is that THEY pay. But it's very easy import a member and pay on their behalf. As, for example, you might want to offer this service as an add-on to a package that you're already selling. No problem.

              <h3 class="mb-1">What if I‚Äôm not trying to profit off my followers/community?</h3>
              <p>
                In this case, just set your price to $3. Then you won‚Äôt profit, but we still will üòÅ. No but in all seriousness, servers ain't free. And also, do you remember Chat Roullete? I promise you that you don't want the moderation nightmare that comes along with allowing free accounts to sign up and post live images of themselves.

              <h3 class="mb-1">I run a nonprofit. Can we get a discount?</h3>
              <p>
                Yeah. <a href="mailto:patrick@lorenzut.com" class="underline">Email me.</a> Most likely you can get a 100% discount. I never was a very good capitalist.

              <h3 class="mb-1">What if I‚Äôm not happy?</h3>
              <p>In life? I‚Äôve personally had great success with both therapy and life coaching. I liked therapy a little more because it felt less outcome-oriented, and therefore it was easier on my anxiety. But YMMV.</p>
              <p>If you‚Äôre not happy with Remote Faces, though... just cancel your membership. You can do it directly from your dashboard. Oh, and when you do this we <strong>automatically</strong> send you a refund for your most recent payment (if you‚Äôve never sent us a payment, we‚Äôll instead send you a haiku). Because we know asking sucks.</p>
              <p>After this, if I‚Äôm not being lazy, I‚Äôll reach out to you and try to ask you a few questions about what led you to cancel. It would be SOOOO helpful if you could answer these questions, even if they hurt my feelings. But you're obviously free not to.</p>
