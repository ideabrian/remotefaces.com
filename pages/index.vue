        <section class="container">            
            <div class="max-w-xl mx-auto">

                <div class="article text-xl">

                    <p class="text-2xl"><em>Turn my audience into a coworking community? Uhhhh... why the hell would I want to do that?</em></p>                   

                    <p>Fair question. Here are three answers:</p>

                    <h2>Answer #1: <span class="bg-yellow-o7">Stop creating exclusive content.</span></h2>

                    <p>Are you an online creator with fans? If so, <strong>hell yeah</strong>! That means you‚Äôve already done the hard part. You‚Äôre already at a point where millions of people dream of being.</p>

                    <p>Now all that‚Äôs left to do is help those fans (because helping people is awesome), and get paid to do it (otherwise you‚Äôll have to go get a real job).</p>                    

                    <div v-if="reason1">   

                        <p>This should be the easy part. This should be the point where you bask in the metaphorical sun while drinking metaphorical martinis, or whatever the cool kids drink these days. I mean, you already have people who love you. And you‚Äôre creative as fuck. </p>
                    
                        <p>So... </p>

                        <p>Ugh.</p>                     

                        <p>Sometimes connecting the dots is really hard. Yes, you have fans. Yes, your fans have money. And yes, your fans WANT to support you with some of that money. But you don‚Äôt know what the heck you‚Äôre supposed to sell them. So you can‚Äôt connect the dots.</p>

                        <p>That‚Äôs where Patreon came to the rescue. Patreon made it so that online creators no longer had to create courses, ebooks, or software products in order to get paid. All they had to was either:</p>

                        <ol class="list-decimal">
                            <li>Hide <strong>X%</strong> of their existing work behind a paywall, or </li>
                            <li>Create <strong>Y%</strong> more content to use as "exclusive content".</li>                            
                        </ol>

                        <p>Both are epic improvements over 10 years ago. But both are still imperfect. Because... what if you don't WANT to pick and choose which of your content should be free and which should be paid? What if you don't WANT to strategically withhold value and creativity from some of your work so you can use it as a carrot?</p>

                        <p>What if, instead, you want to have a FAR BIGGER IMPACT on your fans <em>without</em> doing all of the above? <em>Without</em> "selling out" and altering your creative process?</p>

                        <p>That's where Remote Faces comes in.</p>

                        <p>With Remote Faces you <strong>keep doing what you're already doing</strong>. Keep writing blog posts. Keep editing YouTube videos. Keep recording podcasts.</p>

                        <p>The only change? Let your fans be next to you while you do it.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        
                        <p><span class="link" @click="reason1 = false">Collapse this section.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <p v-if="!reason1"><span class="link" @click="reason1 = true">Expand this section.</span></p>

                    <h2>Answer #2: <span class="bg-yellow-o7">Get paid to help the shit out of your biggest supporters.</span></h2>

                    <p>It‚Äôs human nature to want to help others.</p>

                    <p>Well, for most humans anyway ü§î.</p>

                    <div v-if="reason2">                        

                        <p>It makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It makes us feel important. It's the reason many millenials have everything they've ever dreamed about but are still miserable (because they're working 50 hours a week helping giant companies make shit that nobody needs or really even wants).</p>

                        <p>Helping makes us happy.</p>

                        <p>So... which sounds more helpful to you?</p>

                        <ol class="list-decimal">
                            <li>Catch a fish for a hungry human.</li>
                            <li>Teach a hungry human how to fish.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Trick question, because the answer is actually: <strong>inspire a human to fish</strong>.</p>

                        <p>There are 6 million YouTube videos teaching me how to fish. Cool. Done. These days knowledge is not the problem. Doing the work is.</p>

                        <p>We‚Äôre offering you the chance to inspire the fuck out of the people who like you.</p>
                        <p>We're offering you the chance to motivate others with your mere presence. Which might sound super narcisstic... but we ALL have idols. And we're ALL the object to someone else's idol. So why not make magic?</p>                        

                        <p>And sure, also make a few bucks. But that‚Äôs almost secondary.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="link" @click="reason2 = false">Collapse this section.</span></p>

                    <h2>Answer #3: <span class="bg-yellow-o7">Make it easy for your fans to fall in love with you... and each other.</span></h2>

                    <p>We all know that you‚Äôre a real human. In theory. I mean, we see you on your YouTube channel. We see your thumnail at the top of every blog post your write.</p>
                        
                    <p>But still, there‚Äôs something really cold and impersonal about seeing edited recordings of people.</p>

                    <div v-if="reason3">

                        <p>Remote Faces gives people a behind-the-scenes look at you. It's a place where <strong>it‚Äôs okay to let people see you pick your nose</strong>. It‚Äôs a place where you can be raw, and unfiltered, and unpolished.</p>

                        <p>And I have a hunch that this unpolished side of you will make you wildly more popular. We all fall in love so easily with the girl or boy next door. Precisely because they‚Äôre NOT untouchably perfect.</p>

                        <p>With Remote Faces, you too can be imperfect! You too can be the girl or boy next door!</p>

                        <p>But wait there's more.</p>

                        <p><del>With just 3 easy payments</del> &larr; oh sorry, wrong page.</p>

                        <p>There is more, though.</p>

                        <p>It's not just about your fans seeing you more intimately. It's about you seeing them.</p>

                        <p>When you see your fans you're able to better create things that they want. #marketresearch</p>

                        <p>And when you see your fans... your fans feel seen by you. Logic bomb!</p>

                        <p>Back to business for a quick second. What do you think I‚Äôll give you more money for?</p>
                        <ol class="list-decimal">
                            <li>Being seen by you. And maybe getting an occasional personal note from you.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <p>Yeah.</p>

                        
                        <p><span class="link" @click="reason3 = false">Collapse this section.</span></p>

                    <h2><span class="bg-yellow-o7">To Summarize</span></h2>

                    <p>You‚Äôre a busy creator with fans who want more of you. But... you have so much on your freakin' plate that you don‚Äôt have <em>time</em> to give more. At least not in the current model where giving more means creating exclusive content.</p>

                    <p>So your fans remain fans. Not patrons. üòï</p>

                    <p>This is where we come in.</p>
